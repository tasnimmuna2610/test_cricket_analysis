# test_cricket_analysis
Here I have analysed the data of test cricket. I've found this data from this source:  https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/93276.html
<br>
Objectives of this project: <br>
- Displaying the first 10 rows of the dataframe <br>
- Creating a markdown cell and explain the meaning of each column <br>
- Finding the number of rows and columns in the dataframe <br>
- Finding the data statistics and check for the data types <br>
- Searching for missing values in the dataset <br>
- Renaming the column names appropriately <br>
- Removing a column from the dataframe
