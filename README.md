# test_cricket_analysis
Here I have analysed the data of test cricket. I've found this data from this source:  https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/93276.html
<br>
Objectives of this project:
.Display the first 10 rows of the dataframe
3. Create a markdown cell and explain the meaning of each column
4. find the number of rows and columns in the dataframe
5. find the data statistics and check for the data types
6. Are there any missing values present in the dataset?
7. Rename the column names appropriately
8. Remove a column from the dataframe
